# Enterprise Security & Privacy Standards

## Core Security Principles
* **Validate input and encode output** at all external boundaries
* **AuthN vs AuthZ**: treat separately. Enforce least privilege and defense in depth
* **Secret management**: never commit secrets to VCS. Use secret managers or CI-scoped variables
* **Dependency hygiene**: pin versions, run advisory scans, review transitive risk
* **Secure headers & CSP**: strict CSP, HSTS, frame options, referrer policy, XSS protections

## Data Handling Standards
* **Minimize PII**: classify data, redact logs, define retention and deletion paths
* **Data classification**: public, internal, confidential, restricted
* **Encryption**: at rest and in transit
* **Access controls**: role-based access control (RBAC)
* **Audit logging**: track all data access and modifications

## Security Checklist
* **Threat Modeling** for each feature
* **Security Reviews** for all changes
* **Penetration Testing** for critical systems
* **Vulnerability Scanning** in CI/CD
* **Security Training** for all developers

## Security Metrics
* **Vulnerability Count** = 0 critical, ≤ 5 high
* **Dependency Updates** ≤ 30 days old
* **Security Scans** pass 100%
* **Access Reviews** completed quarterly

## Privacy Compliance
* **GDPR compliance** for EU data
* **CCPA compliance** for California data
* **Data minimization** principles
* **Consent management** systems
* **Right to be forgotten** implementation
